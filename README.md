# Voice-assistant
A basic voice assistant built in Python that listens for voice commands, recognizes specific phrases, and responds with spoken audio. This project leverages speech_recognition for input and gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for output.

Features
Voice Recognition: Listens to your voice using the microphone and transcribes it to text.
Text-to-Speech: Converts responses to audio for an interactive experience.
Command Recognition: Responds to simple commands like "hello" and "what is your name."
